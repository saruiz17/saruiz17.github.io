     Hi! I am Sophie! This my my website that I created. I am creating this website for a class I have in school. So far I have learned the basics of coding and how to create a website. Throughout the classes and my teacher teaching me these new techniques on how to improve my website, I think I can really be succesful and hoping my website will be completed and also to make it be a great website.
